# Deprecation Notice

Current package is deprecated and will not be maintained anymore. The implementation has been moved to leverage the new [AWS Landing Zone Accelerator solution](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/landing-zone-accelerator-on-aws/) ([github](https://github.com/awslabs/landing-zone-accelerator-on-aws)).
